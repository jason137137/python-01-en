# Challenge 1

In the `temp_convert.py` file, write a program that takes in two inputs from the user. The first input should be the temperature and the second input should be the temperature unit. If the input temperature unit is Fahrenheit, the program should convert it to Celsius and vice versa.

- Valid input for temperature degree: any number whether positive or negative.
- Valid input for temperature unit: `"f"` letter for Fahrenheit and `"c"` letter for Celsius.

Complete the code inside the `convert` function that is pre-written for you. We haven't covered user-defined functions yet, but you don't need to know how functions work to complete this Challenge.

> Note: You don't need to test for edge cases like invalid input. We'll learn how to handle edge cases and exceptions later on in the course.
