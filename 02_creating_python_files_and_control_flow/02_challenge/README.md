# Challenge 2

In the `factorial.py` file, write a program that takes a non-negative integer from the user and compute the factorial of this given number. The factorial of a number `n` — denoted by `n!` — is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial function is defined as `n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1`

For instance, the factorial of `5` is: `5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1` which equals `120`.

Complete the code inside the `computer_factorial` function that is pre-written for you. We didn't cover user-defined functions yet but all you need to write for this challenge doesn't involve how functions work.

> Note: You don't need to test for edge cases like invalid input. We'll learn how to handle edge cases and exceptions later on in the course.
