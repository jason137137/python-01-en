## Challenge 1:

Inside `calculator.py`, create a simple calculator program in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations using functions. Adjust the four functions `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` with the correct code to make them function properly.

Make sure to write `if` conditions to ensure the input values to each function are valid. If any input is invalid, return the statement `"bad input"`. If a user attempts to divide a number by zero, the divide function should return the error message `"Cannot divide by zero"`.

Hint: You'll need to parse the input from string to a number as you can't perform arithmetic operations on strings.
