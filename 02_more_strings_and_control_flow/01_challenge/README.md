# Challenge 1

In the `temp_convert.py` file, write a program that takes in two inputs from the user. The first input is the temperature degree and the second input is the temperature unit. If the input temperature unit is Fahrenheit, the program should convert it to Celsius and vice versa.

- Valid input for temperature degree: any number whether positive or negative.
- Valid input for temperature unit: `"f"` letter for Fahrenheit and `"c"` letter for Celsius.

Complete the code inside the `convert` function that is pre-written for you. We didn't cover user-defined functions yet but all you need to write for this challenge doesn't involve how functions work.

> Note: You don't need to test for edge cases like invalid input. We'll learn how to handle edge cases and exceptions later on in the course.
