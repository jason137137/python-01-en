# Challenge 1

1. In the `counter.py` file, write a program that counts the number of items appearing in the `fruits` list. 

2. Save each element as a key in the `occurrences` dictionary. The value of each key should be the number of occurrences of this word.

3. When done, loop over the dictionary to print each key and value in the following structure:

```
banana: 2
apple: 2
orange: 2
grape: 1
melon: 1
kiwi: 1
strawberry: 1
```

Complete the code inside the `counter` function that is pre-written for you. We haven't covered user-defined functions yet, but you don't need to know how functions work in order to complete this challenge.
