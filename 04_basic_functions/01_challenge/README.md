## Challenge 1:

Inside `calculator.py`, create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic. You must complete the four provided functions and use them in your program.

Make sure to write `if` conditions to ensure the input values to each function are valid. If any input to a function is invalid, return the statement `"bad input"` from that function. If a user attempts to divide a number by zero, the divide function should return the error message `"Cannot divide by zero"`.

Hint: You'll need to parse the input from a string to a number as you can't perform arithmetic operations on strings.
