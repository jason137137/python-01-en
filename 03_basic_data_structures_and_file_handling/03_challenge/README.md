# Challenge 3

In `ls_command.py`, develop a Python program that organizes files in a directory based on their extensions. The program should scan a specified directory and group files into folders based on their extensions. Use the os module to navigate the file system and determine file extensions. Create a dictionary where the keys represent file extensions, and the values are lists of file names with the corresponding extension. After organizing the files, display a summary of the number of files in each category.

Expected outputs:

```
Enter directory path to organize files: sample

Summary in alphabetical order:
.md: 1 file
.py: 2 files
.txt: 1 file
```

Complete the code inside the `ls_command` function that is pre-written for you. We haven't covered user-defined functions yet, but you don't need to know how functions work to complete this Challenge.
