## Challenge 1:


Inside `calculator.py`, Create a simple calculator program in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations using functions. The calculator should allow users to `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` numbers. Make sure to write `if` conditions to ensure the input values to each function are valid. If any input is invalid, return the statement `"bad input"`. If a user attempts to divide a number by zero, the divide function should return the error message `"Cannot divide by zero"`.
